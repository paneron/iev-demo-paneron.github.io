  definition: 'density of luminous intensity with respect to projected area in a specified
    direction at a specified point on a real or imaginary surface


    `L_v = ((d I_v))/((d A)) (1)/((cos alpha))`


    where `I`~v~ is luminous intensity, `A` is area and `α` is the angle between the
    normal to the surface at the specified point and the specified direction'

  notes:
  - 'In a practical sense, the definition of luminance can be thought of as dividing
    a real or imaginary surface into an infinite number of infinitesimally small surfaces
    which can be considered as <a href="IEV845-21-033">point sources</a>, each of
    which has a specific luminous intensity, `I`~v~, in the specified direction. The
    luminance of the surface is then the integral of these luminance elements over
    the whole surface.


    The equation in the definition can mathematically be interpreted as a derivative
    (i.e. a rate of change of luminous intensity with projected area) and could alternatively
    be rewritten in terms of the average luminous intensity, `bar I_v`, as:


    `L_v = underset((A -&gt; 0))((lim)) ((bar I_v))/(A) (1)/((cos alpha))`.


    Hence, luminance is often considered as a quotient of averaged quantities; the
    area, `A`, should be small enough so that uncertainties due to variations in luminous
    intensity within that area are negligible; otherwise, the quotient `bar L_v =
    ((bar I_v))/(A) (1)/((cos alpha))` gives the average luminance and the specific
    measurement conditions have to be reported with the result.'
  - For a surface being irradiated, an equivalent formula in terms of illuminance,
    `E`~v~, and solid angle, `Ω`, is `L_v = ((d E_v))/((d omega)) (1)/((cos theta))`,
    where `θ` is the angle between the normal to the surface being irradiated and
    the direction of irradiation. This form is useful when the source has no surface
    (e.g. the sky, the plasma of a discharge).
  - An equivalent formula is `L_v = ((d Phi_v))/((d G))`, where `Φ`~v~ is luminous
    flux and `G` is geometric extent.
  - "Luminous flux can be obtained by integrating luminance over projected area, `A`·cos\
    \ `α`, and solid angle, `Ω`:\r\n`Phi_v = ​ ∬ L_v * cos alpha d A d omega`."
  - Since the <a href="IEV845-21-048">optical extent</a>, expressed by `G·n`^2^, where
    `G` is geometric extent and `n` is refractive index, is invariant, the quantity
    expressed by `L`~v~`·n`^−2^ is also invariant along the path of the beam if the
    losses by absorption, reflection and diffusion are taken as 0. That quantity is
    called "basic luminance".
  - 'The equation in the definition can also be described as a function of luminous
    flux, `Φ`~v~. In this case, it is mathematically interpreted as a second partial
    derivative of the luminous flux at a specified point (`x`, `y`) in space in a
    specified direction (`ϑ`, `φ`) with respect to projected area, `A`·cos `α`, and
    solid angle, `Ω`,


    `L_v ( x , y , vartheta , phi ) = ((del^2 Phi_v ( x , y , vartheta , phi )))/((del
    A ( x , y ) * cos alpha * del omega ( vartheta , phi )))`


    where `α` is the angle between the normal to that area at the specified point
    and the specified direction.'
  - The corresponding radiometric quantity is "radiance". The corresponding quantity
    for photons is "photon radiance".
  - The luminance is expressed in candela per square metre (cd·m^−2^ = lm·m^−2^·sr^−1^).
