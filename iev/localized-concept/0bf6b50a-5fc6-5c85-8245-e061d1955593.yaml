  notes:
  - 'For a function `f ( t )` and a wavelet `psi ( t )`:


    `C_f ( a , b ) = int_(- oo)^(+ oo) f ( t ) psi_(a , b)^( ** ) ( t ) d t`


    where `a` is the scale parameter, `b` is the position parameter, and * denotes
    the complex conjugate.'
  - A discrete wavelet transform is obtained by choosing a finite number of values
    of the two parameters. The inverse transform expresses the function of time as
    a superposition of wavelets.
