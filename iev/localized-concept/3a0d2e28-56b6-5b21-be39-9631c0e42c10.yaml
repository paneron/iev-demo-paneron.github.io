  definition: at a point on the surface separating two media with different thermodynamic
    temperatures, magnitude of the density of heat flow rate *`φ`* divided by the
    absolute value of temperature difference Δ`T`, thus `K = ((| phi |))/((| Delta
    T |))`

  notes:
  - 1 The coefficient of heat transfer is zero for an adiabatic boundary and infinity
    for a diathermic boundary.
  - 2 The name “thermal transmittance” and the symbol `U` are mainly used in building
    technology.
  - 3 The coherent SI unit of coefficient of heat transfer is watt per square metre
    kelvin, W/(m^2^·K).
