  definition: tropospheric propagation between points close to the ground, the reception
    point being beyond the radio horizon of the transmission point

  notes:
  - Trans-horizon propagation may be due to a variety of tropospheric mechanisms such
    as diffraction, scattering, reflection from tropospheric layers. However, ducting
    is not included because in a duct there is no radio horizon.
