    at a given point within a volume element of quasi-infinitesimal volume `V`,
    vector quantity equal to the sum, for all free charge carriers within the
    volume element, of the products of electric charge and velocity, divided by
    the volume `V`:


    `J = (1)/(V) sum_((i = 1))^n Q_i v_i`


    where `n` is the number of free carriers within the volume element, `Q`~`i`~
    the electric charge of the `i`^th^ carrier and `*v*`~`i`~ its velocity

      The flux of the electric current density *`J`* through any directed
      surface S is equal to the electric current `I` through that surface:


      `I = underset(S)( int ) J * e_n d A`


      where `*e*`~n~d`A` is the vector surface element.
