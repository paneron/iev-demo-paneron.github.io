    reverberation-time equation

  notes:
  - 'The Eyring reverberation-time equation is:


    `T = ((( 24 ln 10 ) V))/((- c S ln ( 1 - bar alpha )))`


    where:


    `T` is the reverberation time


    `V` is the volume of the room


    `c` is the speed of sound in the contained air


    `S` = Σ `S`~`i`~ is the total area of surfaces of the room


    `bar alpha = Sigma S_i alpha_i // S` is the area-weighted mean Eyring coefficient
    of all the surfaces


    `S`~`i`~ is the area of the `i`-th surface


    `α`~`i`~ is Eyring sound power absorption coefficient attributed to the `i`-th
    surface. The equivalent absorption area of the `i`-th surface is `S`~`i`~`α`~`i`~.'
