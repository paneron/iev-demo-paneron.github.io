  definition: sum of durations of all {{supply interruptions, IEV:692-07-01}} to individual
    customers during a time interval, divided by the number of these supply interruptions
  examples: []

  notes:
  - 'If `t`~`ij`~ is the duration of the `i`th interruption of supply to customer
    `j` and `n`~`j`~ is the number of times customer `j` is affected during a time
    interval of duration `T`, then the mean duration of a customer interruption is
    given by


    `T_I = ((sum_i sum_j t_((i j))))/((sum_j n_j))`'
  - Only {{sustained interruptions, IEV:692-07-02}} are considered.
  - The term "customer" represents the end user and not some intermediate distribution
    system or company.
  - Mean duration of a customer interruption can be used to describe past performance
    or to estimate expected future performance.
  - This measure is also equal to {{service unavailability per customer served, IEV:692-08-03}}
    divided by {{interruption frequency per customer served, IEV:692-08-01}}.
