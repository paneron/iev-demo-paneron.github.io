  definition: '{{electric relay, IEV:151-13-31}}, the function of which is to control
    equipment


    NoteÂ 1 to entry: A control relay can be a simple relay that translates an external
    command into a control signal [e.g. a command to close a {{circuit-breaker, IEV:441-14-20}}],
    or it can be a more complex {{device, IEV:151-11-20}} that translates an external
    command into a number of sequential control signals [e.g. the closing and opening
    of {{disconnectors, IEV:441-14-05}} and {{circuit-breakers, IEV:441-14-20}} to
    changeover a circuit from one busbar section to another]. A control relay can
    also supervise a {{characteristic quantity, IEV:447-07-01}} (e.g. voltage, frequency)
    and produce a control signal that is dependent upon its specific functional design
    (e.g. under frequency load shedding relay).'
