        at a given point within a volume element of quasi-infinitesimal volume
        `V`, vector quantity equal to the sum, for all free charge carriers
        within the volume element, of the products of electric charge and
        velocity, divided by the volume `V`:


        `J = (1)/(V) sum_((i = 1))^n Q_i v_i`


        where `n` is the number of free carriers within the volume element,
        `Q`~`i`~ the electric charge of the `i`^th^ carrier and `*v*`~`i`~ its
        velocity

      notes:
        - >-
          The flux of the electric current density *`J`* through any directed
          surface S is equal to the electric current `I` through that surface:


          `I = underset(S)( int ) J * e_n d A`


          where `*e*`~n~d`A` is the vector surface element.
